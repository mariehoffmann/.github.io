 # Machine Learning Summary

This blog is intended for those who want to get a comprehensive overview of the basic machine learning (ML) methods. Currently, the ML community subdivides the field 
into
  1. Unsupervised Learning
  2. Supervised Learning
  3. Reinforcement Learning

This blog will be structured likewise as the complexity of the methods increases. E.g., reinforcement learning is deployed in practice with techniques from supervised 
learning, i.e., relevant features of an agent's environment are learned via a neural network.

## Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning

### Linear Regression
$\hat{y}(x) = f(x)$

\(E = mc^2\)

\begin{math}
\begin{eqnarray}
 \hat{y}(x) = f(x)
\end{eqnarray}
\end{math}

### Linear Classifyer


## Reinforcement Learning


#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
